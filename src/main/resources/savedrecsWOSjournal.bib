Abstract = {{A systematic literature review (SLR) is an empirical method used to
   provide an overview of existing knowledge and to aggregate evidence
   within a domain. For computer science, several threats to the
   completeness of such reviews have been identified, leading to
   recommendations and guidelines on how to improve their quality. However,
   few studies address to what extent researchers can replicate an SLR. To
   conduct a replication, researchers have to first understand how the set
   of primary studies has been identified in the original study, and can
   ideally retrieve the same set when following the reported protocol. In
   this article, we focus on this initial step of a replication and report
   a two-fold empirical study: Initially, we performed a tertiary study
   using a sample of SLRs in computer science and identified what
   information that is needed to replicate the searches is reported. Based
   on the results, we conducted a descriptive, multi-case study on digital
   libraries to investigate to what extent these allow replications. The
   results reveal two threats to replications of SLRs: First, while
   researchers have improved the quality of their reports, relevant details
   are still missing-we refer to a reporting threat. Second, we found that
   some digital libraries are inconsistent in their query results-we refer
   to a searching threat. While researchers conducting a review can only
   overcome the first threat and the second may not be an issue for all
   kinds of replications, researchers should be aware of both threats when
   conducting, reviewing, and building on SLRs.}},
