    Abstract       = {{Students are using file sharing sites to breach academic integrity in    light of the Covid-19 pandemic. This paper analyses the use of one such    site, Chegg, which offers ``homework help{''} and other academic    services to students. Chegg is often presented as a file sharing site in    the academic literature, but that is just one of many ways in which it    can be used. As this paper demonstrates, Chegg can and is used for    contract cheating This is despite the apparent existence of an Honour    Code on Chegg which asks students not to breach academic integrity. With    pandemic led safety considerations leading to increased online teaching    and assessment, the paper analyses data relating to how Chegg is used by    students in five STEM subjects, namely Computer Science, Mechanical    Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Physics and Chemistry. The results    show that students are using Chegg to request exam style questions. They    demonstrate that contract cheating requests can be put live and answered    within the short duration of an examination. The number of student    requests posted for these five subjects increased by 196.25\% comparing    the time period April 2019 to August 2019 with the period April 2020 to    August 2020. This increase corresponds with the time when many courses    moved to be delivered and assessed online. The growing number of    requests indicates that students are using Chegg for assessment and exam    help frequently and in a way that is not considered permissible by    universities. The paper concludes by recommending that academic    institutions put interventions in place to minimise the risk to    educational standards posed by sites such as Chegg, particularly since    increased online teaching and assessment may continue after the    pandemic.}},

    Abstract       = {{Probabilistically checkable proofs (PCPs) can be verified based only on    a constant amount of random queries, such that any correct claim has a    proof that is always accepted, and incorrect claims are rejected with    high probability (regardless of the given alleged proof). We consider    two possible features of PCPs:    A PCP is if it rejects an alleged proof of a correct claim with    probability proportional to its distance from some correct proof of that    claim. strongA PCP is smooth if each location in a proof is queried with    equal probability. We prove that all sets in NP have PCPs that are both    smooth and strong, are of polynomial length and can be verified based on    a constant number of queries. This is achieved by following the proof of    the PCP theorem of Arora et al. (JACM 45(3):501-555, 1998), providing a    stronger analysis of the Hadamard and Reed-Muller based PCPs and a    refined PCP composition theorem. In fact, we show that any set in NP has    a smooth strong canonical PCP of Proximity (PCPP), meaning that there is    an efficiently computable bijection of NP witnesses to correct proofs.    This improves on the recent construction of Dinur et al. (in: Blum (ed)    10th innovations in theoretical computer science conference, ITCS, San    Diego, 2019) of PCPPs that are strong canonical but inherently    non-smooth. Our result implies the hardness of approximating the    satisfiability of ``stable{''} 3CNF formulae with bounded variable    occurrence, where stable means that the number of clauses violated by an    assignment is proportional to its distance from a satisfying assignment    (in the relative Hamming metric). This proves a hypothesis used in the    work of Friggstad, Khodamoradi and Salavatipour (in: Chan (ed)    Proceedings of the 30th annual ACM-SIAM symposium on discrete    algorithms, SODA, San Diego, 2019), suggesting a connection between the    hardness of these instances and other stable optimization problems.}},

    Abstract       = {{Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are one of the hottest topics in    computer science and artificial intelligence due to their potential and    advantages in analyzing real-world problems in various disciplines,    including but not limited to physics, biology, chemistry, and    engineering. However, ANNs lack several key characteristics of    biological neural networks, such as sparsity, scale-freeness, and    small-worldness. The concept of sparse and scale-free neural networks    has been introduced to fill this gap. Network sparsity is implemented by    removing weak weights between neurons during the learning process and    replacing them with random weights. When the network is initialized, the    neural network is fully connected, which means the number of weights is    four times the number of neurons. In this study, considering that a    biological neural network has some degree of initial sparsity, we design    an ANN with a prescribed level of initial sparsity. The neural network    is tested on handwritten digits, Arabic characters, CIFAR-10, and    Reuters newswire topics. Simulations show that it is possible to reduce    the number of weights by up to 50\% without losing prediction accuracy.    Moreover, in both cases, the testing time is dramatically reduced    compared with fully connected ANNs.}},

    Abstract       = {{This work presents a new approach to the learning path model in    e-learning systems. The model uses data from the database records from    an e-learning system and uses graphs as representation. In this work,    the authors show how the model can be used to represent visually the    learning paths, behavior analysis, help to suggest group formation for    collaborative activities, and thus assist the teacher in making    decisions. To validate the practical utility of the model, the authors    created two tools, one to visualize the learning paths and another to    suggest groups of students for collaborative activities. Both tools were    tested in a real environment, presenting useful results. The authors    carried experiments with students from three programs: physics,    electrical engineering, and computer science. Experiments show that it    is possible to use the proposed learning path to analyze student    behavior patterns and recommend group formation with positive results.}},

    Volume         = {{6}},
    Year           = {{2021}},
    Abstract       = {{Simulators for photonic quantum information processing (PQIP)    experiments are essentially different with currently available    quantum-circuit simulators. In PQIP experiments, photons are usually    encoded by multiple degrees of freedom, some of which are multi-level or    even infinite-level. Moreover, the evolution of indistinguishable    photons cannot be described elegantly by the model used in    quantum-circuit simulators. A simulator focusing on PQIP experiments is    urgently needed, as it plays an important role in PQIP experiments    designing and verification. We developed PhotoniQLAB, an object-oriented    framework designed for simulating PQIP experiments, which provides a    virtual-lab user experience. The core simulation unit is a computer    algebraic system based on the second quantization method. PhotoniQLAB    only requires users to enter the structure information of a target PQIP    experiment to conduct a simulation, as it can understand the topological    structure by itself. The mathematical foundation and technical details    of PhotoniQLAB are discussed in the paper. The performance of    PhotoniQLAB, which is analyzed and used to simulate several experimental    schemes in this paper, has been shown to be efficient enough for    near-term PQIP experiments. PhotoniQLAB shows its flexibility and    universality, through simulating more than 60 existing PQIP experiments    in published papers. We believe that PhotoniQLAB will become a    fundamental PQIP software infrastructure facilitating the analyses and    designs of PQIP experiments.}},
