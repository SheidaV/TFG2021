Abstract = {{Students are using file sharing sites to breach academic integrity in
   light of the Covid-19 pandemic. This paper analyses the use of one such
   site, Chegg, which offers ``homework help{''} and other academic
   services to students. Chegg is often presented as a file sharing site in
   the academic literature, but that is just one of many ways in which it
   can be used. As this paper demonstrates, Chegg can and is used for
   contract cheating This is despite the apparent existence of an Honour
   Code on Chegg which asks students not to breach academic integrity. With
   pandemic led safety considerations leading to increased online teaching
   and assessment, the paper analyses data relating to how Chegg is used by
   students in five STEM subjects, namely Computer Science, Mechanical
   Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Physics and Chemistry. The results
   show that students are using Chegg to request exam style questions. They
   demonstrate that contract cheating requests can be put live and answered
   within the short duration of an examination. The number of student
   requests posted for these five subjects increased by 196.25\% comparing
   the time period April 2019 to August 2019 with the period April 2020 to
   August 2020. This increase corresponds with the time when many courses
   moved to be delivered and assessed online. The growing number of
   requests indicates that students are using Chegg for assessment and exam
   help frequently and in a way that is not considered permissible by
   universities. The paper concludes by recommending that academic
   institutions put interventions in place to minimise the risk to
   educational standards posed by sites such as Chegg, particularly since
   increased online teaching and assessment may continue after the
   pandemic.}},

Title = {{Smooth and Strong PCPs}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY}},
Year = {{2021}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Probabilistically checkable proofs (PCPs) can be verified based only on
   a constant amount of random queries, such that any correct claim has a
   proof that is always accepted, and incorrect claims are rejected with
   high probability (regardless of the given alleged proof). We consider
   two possible features of PCPs:
   A PCP is if it rejects an alleged proof of a correct claim with
   probability proportional to its distance from some correct proof of that
   claim. strongA PCP is smooth if each location in a proof is queried with
   equal probability. We prove that all sets in NP have PCPs that are both
   smooth and strong, are of polynomial length and can be verified based on
   a constant number of queries. This is achieved by following the proof of
   the PCP theorem of Arora et al. (JACM 45(3):501-555, 1998), providing a
   stronger analysis of the Hadamard and Reed-Muller based PCPs and a
   refined PCP composition theorem. In fact, we show that any set in NP has
   a smooth strong canonical PCP of Proximity (PCPP), meaning that there is
   an efficiently computable bijection of NP witnesses to correct proofs.
   This improves on the recent construction of Dinur et al. (in: Blum (ed)
   10th innovations in theoretical computer science conference, ITCS, San
   Diego, 2019) of PCPPs that are strong canonical but inherently
   non-smooth. Our result implies the hardness of approximating the
   satisfiability of ``stable{''} 3CNF formulae with bounded variable
   occurrence, where stable means that the number of clauses violated by an
   assignment is proportional to its distance from a satisfying assignment
   (in the relative Hamming metric). This proves a hypothesis used in the
   work of Friggstad, Khodamoradi and Salavatipour (in: Chan (ed)
   Proceedings of the 30th annual ACM-SIAM symposium on discrete
   algorithms, SODA, San Diego, 2019), suggesting a connection between the
   hardness of these instances and other stable optimization problems.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are one of the hottest topics in
   computer science and artificial intelligence due to their potential and
   advantages in analyzing real-world problems in various disciplines,
   including but not limited to physics, biology, chemistry, and
   engineering. However, ANNs lack several key characteristics of
   biological neural networks, such as sparsity, scale-freeness, and
   small-worldness. The concept of sparse and scale-free neural networks
   has been introduced to fill this gap. Network sparsity is implemented by
   removing weak weights between neurons during the learning process and
   replacing them with random weights. When the network is initialized, the
   neural network is fully connected, which means the number of weights is
   four times the number of neurons. In this study, considering that a
   biological neural network has some degree of initial sparsity, we design
   an ANN with a prescribed level of initial sparsity. The neural network
   is tested on handwritten digits, Arabic characters, CIFAR-10, and
   Reuters newswire topics. Simulations show that it is possible to reduce
   the number of weights by up to 50\% without losing prediction accuracy.
   Moreover, in both cases, the testing time is dramatically reduced
   compared with fully connected ANNs.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a new approach to the learning path model in

   an e-learning system and uses graphs as representation. In this work,
   the authors show how the model can be used to represent visually the
   learning paths, behavior analysis, help to suggest group formation for
   collaborative activities, and thus assist the teacher in making
   decisions. To validate the practical utility of the model, the authors
   created two tools, one to visualize the learning paths and another to
   suggest groups of students for collaborative activities. Both tools were
   tested in a real environment, presenting useful results. The authors
   carried experiments with students from three programs: physics,
   electrical engineering, and computer science. Experiments show that it
   is possible to use the proposed learning path to analyze student
   behavior patterns and recommend group formation with positive results.}},

Title = {{PhotoniQLAB: a framework for simulating photonic quantum information
   processing experiments}},
Journal = {{QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Simulators for photonic quantum information processing (PQIP)
   experiments are essentially different with currently available
   quantum-circuit simulators. In PQIP experiments, photons are usually
   encoded by multiple degrees of freedom, some of which are multi-level or
   even infinite-level. Moreover, the evolution of indistinguishable
   photons cannot be described elegantly by the model used in
   quantum-circuit simulators. A simulator focusing on PQIP experiments is
   urgently needed, as it plays an important role in PQIP experiments
   designing and verification. We developed PhotoniQLAB, an object-oriented
   framework designed for simulating PQIP experiments, which provides a
   virtual-lab user experience. The core simulation unit is a computer
   algebraic system based on the second quantization method. PhotoniQLAB
   only requires users to enter the structure information of a target PQIP
   experiment to conduct a simulation, as it can understand the topological
   structure by itself. The mathematical foundation and technical details
   of PhotoniQLAB are discussed in the paper. The performance of
   PhotoniQLAB, which is analyzed and used to simulate several experimental
   schemes in this paper, has been shown to be efficient enough for
   near-term PQIP experiments. PhotoniQLAB shows its flexibility and
   universality, through simulating more than 60 existing PQIP experiments
   in published papers. We believe that PhotoniQLAB will become a
   fundamental PQIP software infrastructure facilitating the analyses and
   designs of PQIP experiments.}},
