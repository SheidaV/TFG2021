Abstract = {{Beginners are often unaccustomed to the abstract and formal thinking
   required in tertiary computer science education. This can be alleviated
   through close support provided by an experienced person, like a teacher.
   Nowadays, such support is hardly possible because, in computer science,
   instructors face classes of a few ten to a few hundred students. This
   article shows how scaffolding and feedback needed by computer science
   beginners can be provided by software. The particularly difficult case
   of building logical proofs is considered so as to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the approach. The approach to computer-provided
   scaffolding and feedback presented in this article is based on
   specifically designed proof editors that relieve learners from some
   choices and tasks - scaffolding - and provide immediate feedback on
   those tasks left to the learners. Building logical proofs is especially
   challenging - not only for beginners - because it includes various
   challenges: Understanding definitions, building a syntactically correct
   proof, and correctly applying complex proof building rules. This article
   introduces two specialized editors that support students in learning the
   proof methods Resolution and Natural Deduction. The editors make it
   possible for learners to focus on the correct order of rule application
   - the most challenging part of proof building -, by relieving them of
   the other aspects of proof building, and providing immediate feedback on
   the correctness of proof construction tasks performed by the learners.
   The contributions of this article are twofold: First, the conception and
   implementation of two original graphical proof editors, and second, a
   report on an evaluation of the editors and the feedback and scaffolding
   they provide pointing to the educational approach's effectiveness.}},
